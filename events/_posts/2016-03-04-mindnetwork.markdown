The Mind Network fosters a community of UK and nearby researchers in philosophy of mind and philosophy of cognitive science, and aims to build links with the wider international community. The Mind Network has biannual mobile, UK-based meetings.

The meetings aim to get researchers in philosophy of mind and cognitive science in one place to present papers, discuss their work, exchange ideas, become participants in a community, and have a good time. Students are particularly welcomed.
