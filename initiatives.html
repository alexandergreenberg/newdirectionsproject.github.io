<h1>Apply for funding</h1>

<p>The New Directions in the Study of the Mind funds a number of smaller research projects as part of this initiative. Philosophers, psychologists and neuroscientists are invited to apply for funding for these projects.</p>

<p>There will be two calls for proposals. The first call is now closed. The second call for proposals will open in 2016. Proposals will be evaluated by the project team and a selection of external experts.</p>
