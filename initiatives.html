<h1>Get funded</h1>

<p>Do you have an idea for a project that takes a non-physicalist or non-reductionist approach to the mind? We would love to hear from you. We currently invite proposals for philosophical and scientific approaches to the study of the mind which do not make the physicalist and reductionist assumptions familiar in these disciplines.</p> 

<p>Successful proposals will be part of the research funding initiative New Directions in the Study of the Mind, based at the Faculty of Philosophy in the University of Cambridge.</p> 

<p>The current request for proposals is for the academic year 2016-17.</p> 

<p>The total value of all the projects to be funded in this second call will be in the region of £150K. Please note that the funding available for each proposal is unlikely to exceed £10,000.</p>

<p>Proposals can be for funding that supports various research needs: a workshop or a conference; a period of leave to work on a piece of work under the general heading of the project; a research visit to Cambridge to spend time in discussion with the project members; help with bringing a project to publication; and any other reasonable request for support (e.g. the purchase of books or other materials) for research initiatives which fall under the general project heading.</p> 

<h2>Application process</h2>

<p>This is the Project’s second and final request for proposals.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Letters of intent should be received by 31 July 2016.</li>
	<li>Letters of intent should explain the proposal’s relation to the central questions of the Cambridge New Directions Project, the background and significance of the activity being pursued, and a summary of its main ideas or arguments. The letter should not exceed 1,500 words (excluding references).</li>
	<li>Letters of intent should be accompanied by a complete curriculum vitae for the project leader and all other team members (if applicable); and a specification of the amount of funding requested (a one-sentence description is acceptable). No budget narrative or justification is needed at this stage. The amount can be revised at the full proposal stage.</li> 
</ul>

<p> Applicants will be informed by 7 August 2016 about whether they are invited to submit a full proposal. Those invited to submit full proposals should submit them by 15 August 2016.</p>

<p>Submissions should be made via our
