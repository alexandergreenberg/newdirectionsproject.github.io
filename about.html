<p>A metaphysical account of the mind specifies the most general categories in terms of which we should understand mental phenomena.</p> 

<p>Should we employ the category of substance, or event, or property in our most general theory of the mind? To what extent should we employ the categories of commonsense or ‘folk’ psychology in our theorizing about the mind? What are the fundamental ways of dividing and distinguishing mental phenomena? Should it be in terms of consciousness, intentionality (or mental representation), both or neither?</p>

<h2>Physicalism</h2>

<p>Contemporary metaphysics of mind tends to be physicalist and reductionist, and it tends to approach all the above questions in this light. Physicalism holds that the world is fundamentally physical. The fundamental reality of the world is the reality described by physics and physical science: the world of particles, spacetime, forces and fields. All other phenomena have their reality vindicated by being demonstrated to ‘reduce’ (in one or another sense) to physical phenomena.</p> 

<p>So if the mind is real, then the mind must reduce to something physical, either by being shown to be identical with some physical thing, or to metaphysically depend on physical reality, or to be constituted by physical reality, or in some other way. Consciousness must be shown to be reducible to something physical, intentionality must be given a reductive explanation, and the metaphysical categories of substance, event and property must have their credentials validated by showing how they can be incorporated by this physicalist worldview.</p> 

<p>According to physicalism, if mental phenomena cannot be shown to be physical, then their reality must be called into question. This has been the dominant approach to the metaphysics of mind for the last sixty years or so.</p> 

<h2>Non-physicalist approaches</h2>

<p>The overall aim of the Cambridge New Directions project is to investigate some alternative ways of approaching the metaphysics of mind. In particular, the project will examine the viability of non-physicalist and non-reductive approaches to the study of the central mental phenomena of consciousness and intentionality.</p> 

<p>While there has been a considerable debate about whether physicalism is true (see Robinson 1993, Gillett and Loewer 2001, Bealer and Koons 2010) less attention has been paid to working out the details of a non-physicalist picture. The debate over physicalism has taken the form of discussion of counterexamples to physicalism (see Chalmers 1996) and certain canonical arguments (e.g. the knowledge argument of Jackson 1982 and Robinson 1982).</p> 

<p>The discussion has been largely about the truth of physicalism; there has been less discussion of the details of alternatives to physicalism, and what non-physicalist accounts of specific mental phenomena might look like.</p>

<p>While the project will not explicitly reject physicalism nor all forms of reductionism, it aims to open up the discussion and explore alternatives to physicalism and reductionism in various areas of the philosophical and scientific study of the mind. The project is conceived as exploratory rather than ideological.</p>

<h2>The scientific study of the mind</h2>

<p>Sometimes it is said that a scientific approach to the mind requires the truth of physicalism (Poland 1993), and many arguments for physicalism assume that it is the only metaphysical picture which is properly harmonious with modern science.</p> 

<p>The current project rejects this assumption. It will maintain that the scientific investigation of the mind – by psychology and neuroscience – does not require that physicalism is true.</p> 

<p>One of the distinctive features of this project, then, is the combination of a skeptical attitude to physicalism with a fully scientific approach to the mind. In this sense, then, the project is consistent with naturalism, where that doctrine is understood in terms of the holistic continuity of philosophical and scientific knowledge. But it is not consistent with naturalism understood (as it by, e.g., Papineau 1992) as a form of physicalism.</p>

<h2>Consciousness and intentionality</h2>

<p>The two central mental categories to be explored in this project are consciousness and intentionality.</p> 

<p>Consciousness, the awareness of the world in experience and thought, has been one of the stumbling blocks for physicalist theories of the mind (Nagel 1970, Chalmers 1996, Levine 2001). The project will look at the investigation of consciousness in another way. Rather than looking for a reductive physicalist account, the project will attempt to chart the elements of the ontology of consciousness from a non-reductive perspective.</p> 

<p>It will address questions such as: what are the categories to which conscious phenomena belong? Is the consciousness involved in sensory experience of a different kind from the consciousness involved in thought? How should the various forms of consciousness be investigated from a non-reductionist perspective?</p>

<p>Similarly with intentionality. The central questions about intentionality can be asked independently of the truth of physicalism: are all mental phenomena intentional? Is intentionality a relation? How can intentional states represent things that do not exist? What is the relationship between intentionality and consciousness? What roles do the central notions of the theory of intentionality (e.g. object, content, mode) play in the empirical sciences of the mind?</p>

<p>The guiding assumption of this project is that these questions can be addressed by the philosophy and science of the mind without necessarily adopting a physicalist or reductionist approach.</p>
