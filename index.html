<h1>Research Project</h1>

<p>The aim of the New Directions in the Study of the Mind Project is to investigate questions about intentionality and consciousness from a non-physicalist, non-reductive perspective.</p> 

<p>The project will last for two years, from July 2015 to July 2017. There will be a weekly seminar in Cambridge lasting for two academic years, a number of workshops, and a major conference, among other activities.

In addition, there will be a call for proposals for smaller projects to be funded by the project. The call for proposals will be announced in early July 2015. 

Proposals will be evaluated by the project team, consisting of: Tim Crane (project leader), two postdoctoral fellows, one temporary lecturer and a part-time administrator.

The research project is based at the Faculty of Philosophy in Cambridge, and supported by the John Templeton Foundation.</p>
