<h1>Research Project</h1>

<p>The New Directions in the Study of the Mind Project aims to investigate questions about intentionality and consciousness from a non-physicalist, non-reductive perspective.</p> 

<p>The project will last for two years, from July 2015 to July 2017. There will be a weekly seminar in Cambridge lasting for two academic years, a number of workshops, and a major conference, among other activities.</p>

<p>A call for proposals for smaller projects to be funded by the project will be announced in early July 2015. Proposals will be evaluated by the project team.</p>

<p>The research project is based at the Faculty of Philosophy in Cambridge, and supported by the John Templeton Foundation.</p>
