<p>In July 2015 a new research project will begin at the Faculty of Philosophy in Cambridge, supported by the <a href="http://www.templeton.org/">John Templeton Foundation</a>. The aim of this project is to investigate questions about intentionality and consciousness from a non-physicalist, non-reductive perspective.</p> 

<p>More detail about the intellectual and historical background, as well as the research questions of the project, may be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The project will last for two years, from July 2015 to July 2017. There will be a weekly seminar in Cambridge lasting for two academic years, a number of workshops, and a major conference, among other activities.</p>

<p>In addition, there will be a call for proposals for smaller projects to be funded by the project. The call for proposals will be announced in early July 2015. Proposals will be evaluated by the project team, consisting of: Tim Crane (the project leader), two postdoctoral fellows, one temporary lecturer and a part-time administrator.</p>
